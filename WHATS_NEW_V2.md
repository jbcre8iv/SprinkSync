## ⛈️ Smart Weather Integration

### Weather-Based Intelligence
- **Real-time weather data** from OpenWeatherMap
- **5-day forecast caching** (refreshes every 4 hours)
- **Profile-specific thresholds** - Different profiles react differently to weather!
  - Lawn: Skips on 0.25" rain
  - Vineyard: Needs 0.5" to skip (drought-tolerant)
  - Track: Doesn't skip - may water BEFORE rain!

### Smart Skip Logic
- **Rain prediction** - Skip watering if rain is forecast
- **Freeze protection** - Skip when temps below 32°F
- **Heat adjustment** - Increase watering when temps exceed 85°F
- **Cool weather reduction** - Reduce watering when temps drop below 60°F
- **Wind monitoring** - Dust control increases watering when wind picks up!

### Profile-Specific Weather Behaviors

**Residential Lawn:**
- Skip on 0.25" rain forecast
- Skip on freeze
- Increase 50% in extreme heat

**Motocross Track:**
- Waters BEFORE rain to help compact track
- Increases watering on windy days (dust control)
- Multiple daily watering cycles

**Vineyard:**
- Intentional water stress in heat (improves wine quality!)
- Waters before freeze for frost protection
- Reduces watering 4-6 weeks before harvest

**Dust Control:**
- Wind-sensitive (increases when wind >10mph)
- Multiple short bursts per day
- Focus on PM10 reduction
